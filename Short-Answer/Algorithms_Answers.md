#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity of this code block is O(n) - this is because the operation within our while loop is constant and depends on the value of n.


b) This kind of threw me off initially - I thought it would be exponential due to the nested for loops, however, the time complexity of this code block is O(log n) - this is because the complexity decreases over time due to j always being multiplied by 2.


c) The time complexity of this code block would be O(n) - the recursion acts as a loop, decreasing n linearly, where n is the number of bunnies.
